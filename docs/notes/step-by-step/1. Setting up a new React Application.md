1. Open your terminal
2. Check that NodeJS and NPM is installed by running `node --version && npm --version` 
	   A major version number higher than 16 for NodeJS is fine, less is bad

3. A set of instructions is now visible in your terminal follow them to start the development server.
4. Open the URL link that is output to look at the example project.
